MC-09 is suprisingly cool little module, with fat and crispy lo-fi character. It doesn't look fancy, but can produce extremely fat and powerful sounds. Sequencer is a little hard to program, so I just pluged it to my MIDI interface and recorded the samples.

This pack contains 128 Bass, Synth and FX sounds, including Subs, Sweeps, Acid Loops, Waveforms, Drops, Wow and SQ Bases, and much more.

Wav format, 24 bit, 44100, mono
